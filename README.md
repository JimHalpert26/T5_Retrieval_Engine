Some points to be taken care of while doing local testing :-
<br>
- If you're making some local changes, then you can find out your User-Agents in HTTP headers [in this link](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent/).
- If you're making some changes to imageSearch, then for more aesthetic results on your local machine, set the image css properties in templates/imageSearch.html to your computer screen's desirable values.
